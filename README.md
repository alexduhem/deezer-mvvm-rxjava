# deezer-mvvm-rxjava
Just a test with MVVM, Rxjava and the deezer api

# Notes :
- I used Android Studio 3 canary 4, because Java 8 (for lambda/retro lambda) and the Jack toolchain is a pain in the ass (sometimes 3min to build the app oO), so maybe the jackEnable = true has to be added in the gradle file for guys with android studio 2.3.3.

- I didn't handle the rotation and the savedInstanceState stuff, and tablet UI

- The UI is quite shitty, but i assume that's not really the point of the test

- The classes are separated in 3 big packages : view, model, and viewmodel. For a bigger project, I might eventually separate the package into features
